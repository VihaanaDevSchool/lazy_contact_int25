Nice ðŸ˜Ž youâ€™re aiming for a **LAN-accessible demo app** â†’ anyone on the same WiFi can open your app in their browser. Thatâ€™s a very good touch for showing it off.

Hereâ€™s how weâ€™ll make it work:

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Make backend bind to all interfaces

Right now your app likely has something like:

```ts
app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log("ðŸš€ Server running at http://localhost:5000");
});
```

This only binds to `localhost`. Change it to:

```ts
app.listen(5000, "0.0.0.0", () => {
  console.log("ðŸš€ Server running at http://0.0.0.0:5000");
});
```

ðŸ‘‰ This tells Express to listen on **all network interfaces**, not just `localhost`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Docker: expose the app correctly

In your `docker-compose.yml`, you already have:

```yaml
ports:
  - "5000:5000"
```

Thatâ€™s good â€” it maps the containerâ€™s port 5000 to your host machineâ€™s port 5000.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Find your host machineâ€™s LAN IP

Run on your host machine (NixOS):

```bash
ip addr show | grep inet
```

Look for something like `192.168.x.x` (usually your WiFi adapter).
Letâ€™s say your laptop IP = `192.168.1.42`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Access from another device

Now, anyone connected to the same WiFi can open:

```
http://192.168.1.42:5000
```

That will show your backend.
Once frontend is added, same URL will serve the app.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. (Optional) Disable firewall for demo

If you have firewall rules blocking external access, allow port 5000:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5000 -j ACCEPT
```

Or if using `firewalld`:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=5000/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Demo workflow

- Run `docker-compose up`.
- Share your laptopâ€™s IP (e.g. `192.168.1.42:5000`) with others on WiFi.
- They can open it from phone/laptop and see your app live.

âš¡ Pro tip: When you show this, also open MongoDB container (`mongo-express` or similar) â†’ so people can see live database updates when they add/edit contacts. Looks **very professional**.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to add **Mongo Express container** (GUI for MongoDB) into your `docker-compose.yml`, so during demo you can show DB updates visually?
